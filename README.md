Aim Of The Project:
- Build a dataset of Instagram Influencers.
- Analyse main trends in Instagram.
- Build a model to predict number of likes for a new post.
- Employ pretrained model for object detection.
- Build hashtag recommender.
- Deploy a model as a Telegram Bot.

## The resulting model can be useful for:
- Instagram users with more than 500 followers and public accounts who want to know the future for their new post and do not like to choose hashtags manually.
- Companies which like to advertise their products through influencers and don't know how to choose between similar influencers.
